# Security

## IMPORTANT

We do not accept AI generated security reports. We receive a large number of
these and we absolutely do not have the resources to review them all. If you
submit one that will be an automatic ban from the project.

## Threat Model

### Overview

ZYRAXON is an AI-powered coding assistant that runs locally on your machine. It provides an agent system with access to powerful tools including shell execution, file operations, web access, YouTube streaming, and desktop automation.

### No Sandbox

ZYRAXON does **not** sandbox the agent. The permission system exists as a UX feature to help users stay aware of what actions the agent is taking - it prompts for confirmation before executing commands, writing files, etc. However, it is not designed to provide security isolation.

If you need true isolation, run ZYRAXON inside a Docker container or VM.

### Server Mode

Server mode is opt-in only. When enabled, set `ZYRAXON_SERVER_PASSWORD` to require HTTP Basic Auth. Without this, the server runs unauthenticated (with a warning). It is the end user's responsibility to secure the server - any functionality it provides is not a vulnerability.

### Security Features

- **136+ MCP Tools** — All tools have input validation and sanitized command execution
- **Cross-Platform Safety** — Commands adapted per-platform (no shell injection vectors)
- **Safe Math Evaluation** — Calculator tools use sanitized input (no eval vulnerability)
- **No Hardcoded Secrets** — All credentials stored in auth.json or environment variables
- **RTMP Stream Key Protection** — Stream keys sanitized before logging (no plaintext exposure)
- **Self-Healing Audit Trail** — All auto-installs and self-modifications are logged
- **Memory Encryption** — Permanent memory stored locally, never sent to external services
- **Tor Integration** — Optional anonymous browsing through Tor network for recon tasks

### Out of Scope

| Category                        | Rationale                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Server access when opted-in** | If you enable server mode, API access is expected behavior              |
| **Sandbox escapes**             | The permission system is not a sandbox (see above)                      |
| **LLM provider data handling**  | Data sent to your configured LLM provider is governed by their policies |
| **MCP server behavior**         | External MCP servers you configure are outside our trust boundary       |
| **Malicious config files**      | Users control their own config; modifying it is not an attack vector    |
